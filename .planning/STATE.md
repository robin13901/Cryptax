# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-21)

**Core value:** Accurate German crypto tax calculation with FIFO-based holding period tracking, producing a Finanzamt-ready Steuerreport.
**Current focus:** Phase 4 complete — ready for Phase 5

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 7 (FIFO Engine + Tax Calculation) — Complete
Plan: 8 of 8 in current phase
Status: Complete — all plans executed, verified (5/5 criteria passed)
Last activity: 2026-03-22 — Phase 4 verified and closed

Progress: [██████░░░░] 59% (29/49 plans complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 29
- Average duration: ~8 min
- Total execution time: ~224 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation-ci-cd | 7/7 COMPLETE | ~44 min | ~6 min |
| 02-csv-import-pipeline | 8/8 COMPLETE | ~46 min | ~6 min |
| 03-eur-price-enrichment | 5/5 COMPLETE | ~50 min | ~10 min |
| 04-fifo-engine-tax-calculation | 8/8 COMPLETE | ~61 min | ~8 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 8 min
- Trend: consistent

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- 04-01: HALTEFRIST_DAYS=366 — conservative: Jan 1 buy is tax-free Jan 2 next year (366 days elapsed)
- 04-01: Decimal import in NodeNext must be named export { Decimal } from 'decimal.js' — default/re-export resolves to namespace only
- 04-01: checkNullPrices returns empty array on pass, array of NullPriceError on failure — caller decides abort
- 04-01: SKIPPABLE_CANONICAL_TYPES = transfer_in/out, earn_withdrawal, fee, unknown — intentionally excluded from NULL price check
- 04-02: Fee conversion uses eurPrice multiplier for both spot_tx and spot_order (feeEur = fee * eurPrice) — consistent approximation
- 04-02: Excess sell generates both consumption records AND sellsWithoutLots entry — partial match + error flag
- 04-02: FIFO tiebreak: buys (key=0) before sells (key=1) at same timestamp
- 04-03: Futures opens (open_long/short) skipped — opening a position is not a taxable event under German law
- 04-03: Fee sign convention: feeEur stored as positive abs() value; source amounts are negative but reporting uses positive fees
- 04-03: Set-based FUTURES_TAXABLE_TYPES guard — clean O(1) filter over switch/if chains
- 04-04: Freigrenze cliff uses netGainEur only (haltefristMet=false records); tax-free gains excluded from net entirely
- 04-04: Haltefrist-met losses are ignored (no tax benefit, no liability); only non-exempt records enter netting
- 04-04: tradeCount via Set<number> on sellTransactionId — unique sells, not lot pairings
- 04-05: Freigrenze not applied in earn engine — deferred to orchestrator for per-year aggregate cliff check
- 04-05: earn_withdrawal skipped with specific reason (distinguishes from generic non-earn skip)
- 04-05: FIFO lot feeEur = ZERO — earn has no acquisition cost beyond the fair market value
- 04-05: costPerUnitEur = eurPrice directly — cost basis is purely fair market value at receipt (no fee adjustment)
- 04-06: Earn lots fed into FIFO via synthetic buy transactions (canonicalType='buy') — earn engine still runs separately for §22 income records
- 04-06: §23 estimatedTaxEur = 0 — marginal rate unknown; only Abgeltungssteuer (futures, 26.375%) is computable without user tax data
- 04-06: Earn Freigrenze cliff at 256 EUR applied at orchestrator level per-year aggregate
- 04-06: Futures net P&L = sum(realizedPnlEur) - sum(feeEur) per year; only positive net is taxable (no Freigrenze)
- 04-06: DB writes inside single db.transaction() — atomic: either all 5 tables written or none
- 04-08: Golden master tests reuse in-memory SQLite + full migrations pattern — no mocking
- 04-08: Property tests target runFifoEngine directly (pure function, no DB) — faster, 100 runs each

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 7 research flag: ccxt Bitget v2 deep history pagination is untested
- German tax law: Haltefrist exact day count — RESOLVED: using 366 days (conservative interpretation per 04-01)
- Migration workflow: After `npm run db:generate`, manually add STRICT to new CREATE TABLE statements
